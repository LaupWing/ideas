# Ideas
In this repository you can find all my ideas and notes.

## Main Directions
I have certain directions of websites i want to maken. Most of mine own web projects are related to improving your daily routine. Because you only have one life and each day is special so make the best out of it!

Things i hope to achiev with my projects are:
*   Reflect on the past you (people get motivated when they see they have improved in certain areas of their life)
    *   User has to fill in what they have learned and when time passes by they can see their improvements
*   Document knowledge
*   Goal setting (Another motivating strategy is to set goals for in the future)
